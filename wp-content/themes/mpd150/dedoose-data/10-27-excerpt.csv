M: It's not cut in the dry, but there are steps in conversation, with people who are mentally unstable, or people who have rage issues. Right? Just emotion regulation. I see someone with mental illness, I gague whether or not they're suicidal. Like, are they going to hurt themselves? There's literally a script you can ask, if you're suicidal. There's also a script you can ask if you're homicdal. So you start with that, right? Am I at risk of getting hurt, or is this person at risk of hurting themselves. If they answer correctly to most of those questions, I'm calling the cops. I have to, I'm a mandated reporter. But if someone's making empty threats, like if I come at them they're gonna stab me, I'm like, ""Do you REALLY mean that?"" You know what I mean? Just asking questions, you can make a conversation of this person's crisis to the point where you can get them to calm down. And that's what I train my staff on. SO, I don't know if you've ever had an anxiety attack, but it starts with the self, like you hype yourself up, and it no one intervenes, it can be really bad for you. But if you have someone with a soft voice who's willing to hear you out and validate what you're going through, chances are, like human reaction: if someone's calm, with human reaction you can get yourself to calm back down. Right? So I try and approach it with simple human nature so it's not so dauting. Cause when people say ""Oh mental health clients? What do you mean I can't call the cops? I'm freaking out, I'm scared."" So, if you're coming from a point of 101 conversation, this is what you do when you have a regular conversation with somebody, it makes it a lot easier.
